\\ Question 4.1-1
What does FIND MAXIMUM SUBARRAY return when all elements of A are negative? 
\\ Answer
If all the elements are negative, the maximum subarray will return a single elements - the largest element of A 

\\ Question 4.1-2 
Write pseudocode for the brute force method os solving the max-subarray problem. Your procedure should run in Î˜(n^2) time. 
\\ Answer 
left = low
right = high
sum = INT_MIN
for i = low to high
  tempSum = 0
  for j = i to high 
    tempSum = tempSum + A[j]
    if tempSum > sum 
      sum = tempSum 
      left = i 
      right = j 
      
\\ Question 4.1-3
Implement both the brute-force and recursive algorithms for the maximumsubarray problem on your own computer. What problem size n_0 gives the crossover point at which the recursive algorithm beats the brute-force algorithm? Then, change the base case of the recursive algorithm to use the brute-force algorithm whenever the problem size is less than n_0. Does that change the crossover point?
